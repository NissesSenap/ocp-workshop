# Requirement

To be able to use tekton/openshift pipelines need to install the tekton operator.

If you are on OCP 4.5 you can go in to OLM make sure that you are getting openshift pipelines 1.1 or never.
At the time of writing this it's in the preview channel.

If you are not on OCP go to the [operatorhub](https://operatorhub.io/operator/tektoncd-operator) and follow the instructions
or go to the tekton install [docs](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md).

## CLI

Also worth getting is the [tekton cli](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases).
